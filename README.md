# Compiled programming language

*Version 0.0.4*

Shard is a small programming language in active development. It uses Python and PLY to generate C code.

## Last changes
- Data types limits handling

## Features
- Arithmetic operations
- Variables declarations, assignments and operations
- Installation program

## Installation
*Notice that the automatic installation support is only available on Linux systems*

**Step 1**: clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://shard-language/shard
```

**Step 2**: open the Shard directory
```bash
cd shard
```

**Step 3**: start a root session and run the installation program with the following commands
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**Step 4**: check if Shard has been successfully installed
```bash
shard --version
```
You should see this:
```
Shard compiler version 0.0.3 released under MIT license
```

## Run your first program
Here is an example of a program you can write:
```
byte x;
x = 5;
x + 3;
```

Next, compile it with:
```bash
shard -c my_program.shd     # you can use --compile instead of -c
```

The generated C code should be:
```c
/*
   This file has been automatically generated by the Shard compiler.
   Do not edit instead if you need to edit the generated code.
*/

int main() {
  char x;
  x = (5);
  ((x) + 3);
   return 0;
}
```

Finally, compile the C file with your favorite C compiler (like GCC or Clang)!

## Data types
`byte`: 8-bit integer
`word`: 16-bit integer
`dword`: 32-bit integer
`float`: 32-bit float
`qword`: 64-bit integer
`double`: 64-bit float

## Operators
Arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
Assignments: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
